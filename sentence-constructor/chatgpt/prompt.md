## Formatting instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:
- vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and considerations

### Vocabulary table
- the table should only have the following columns: Chinese, pinyin, English

### Sentence structure
- do not provide the answer or the examples of the words to use in the sentence structure

### Clues and considerations
